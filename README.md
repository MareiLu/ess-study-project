Cross-Country Comparison Questions
- comparison between countries or groups of countries:
7. How do levels of trust in the EU and UN vary across Western vs. Eastern European countries, and what role does immigration play in this?
8. Do countries with high satisfaction with democracy tend to be more welcoming toward immigrants from poorer countries?

Attitudes and Values-Focused Questions
- for more nuanced psychological/political behavior studies:
11. Is there a correlation between general trust in people (social trust) and openness to immigrants?
