Temporal/Longitudinal Questions
- good if you want to compare trends over time (multiple ESS rounds):
4. Has trust in political institutions declined over time, and does this correlate with rising anti-immigrant sentiment?

Cross-Country Comparison Questions
- comparison between countries or groups of countries:
7. How do levels of trust in the EU and UN vary across Western vs. Eastern European countries, and what role does immigration play in this?
8. Do countries with high satisfaction with democracy tend to be more welcoming toward immigrants from poorer countries?

Attitudes and Values-Focused Questions
- for more nuanced psychological/political behavior studies:
11. Is there a correlation between general trust in people (social trust) and openness to immigrants?


Comparative Political Attitudes
“How do perceptions of political competence (internal efficacy) differ between younger and older people across democracies?”
→ Focus on age groups, political self-efficacy, cross-country variation

“Is trust in political parties linked to perceived fairness of the political system – and how does this differ between Eastern and Western Europe?”
→ Compare regions; link institutional trust with system legitimacy

🧠 Psychological and Subjective Factors in Political Attitudes
“What role does perceived safety play in support for authoritarian attitudes?”
→ Combine crime perception and authoritarian value items

“How is political knowledge linked to preferences for strong authoritarian leadership?”
→ Link media consumption/information and “strong leader” preferences

“To what extent do socioeconomic factors influence trust in the police – compared to other institutions?”
→ Examine education, income, migration background vs. trust in police, parliament, parties
