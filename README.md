- How do levels of trust in the EU and UN vary across Western vs. Eastern European countries, and what role does immigration play in this?
- How do perceptions of political competence (internal efficacy) differ between younger and older people across democracies? (media)


🧠 3. How do perceptions of political competence (internal efficacy) differ between younger and older people across democracies?
A. Media use as a mediator
“Does political interest or media consumption mediate the age gap in political efficacy?”

– Variables: agea, polcmpl, polintr, newsfreq or media trust variables.

B. Digital divide question
“Are younger people more politically competent because of greater media consumption, or despite lower political trust?”

– Contrasts age groups on polcmpl controlling for polintr, trstplt.

C. Cross-country differences in the age gap
“Is the age gap in political efficacy larger in countries with low political trust overall?”

– Interaction: agea × cntry, with country-level mean trstplt as contextual variable.
