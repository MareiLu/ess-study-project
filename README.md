🌍 2. How do levels of trust in the EU and UN vary across Western vs. Eastern European countries, and what role does immigration play in this?

  A. The regional gap hypothesis
  “Are citizens of Western Europe systematically more trusting of the EU and UN than those in Eastern Europe, even after controlling for immigration attitudes?”
  
  – Controls: imsmetn, imdfetn, impcntr; group cntry into East/West.
  
  B. Immigration attitudes as a moderator
  “Does the effect of region (West vs. East) on trust in the EU/UN depend on attitudes toward immigration?”
  
  – Test interaction terms: region × imsmetn, etc.
  
  C. Generational and regional perspective
  “Is trust in international institutions higher among younger respondents in Eastern Europe, suggesting a generational shift?”

  – Adds agea and interaction with region.

🧠 3. How do perceptions of political competence (internal efficacy) differ between younger and older people across democracies?

  A. Media use as a mediator
  “Does political interest or media consumption mediate the age gap in political efficacy?”
  
  – Variables: agea, polcmpl, polintr, newsfreq or media trust variables.
  
  B. Digital divide question
  “Are younger people more politically competent because of greater media consumption, or despite lower political trust?”
  
  – Contrasts age groups on polcmpl controlling for polintr, trstplt.

  C. Cross-country differences in the age gap
  “Is the age gap in political efficacy larger in countries with low political trust overall?”
  
  – Interaction: agea × cntry, with country-level mean trstplt as contextual variable.
