###Research Question
# - Ursprüngliche Frage: “Are younger people more politically competent because of greater media consumption, or despite lower political trust?” --> umgeändert zu "Do media consumption or political trust affect political competency differently among different age groups?"
# - Problem: Political competent variable (polcmpl) only available from rounds 1-4, media variables only available from rounds 8-11 --> new research question necessary

# - Erste mögliche alternative Frage: "Are younger people more interested in politics because of higher media use, despite lower trust in politicians?" --> Outcome variable ist political interest

# - Zweite mögliche alternativeFrage: "How does higher media consumption affect political trust among different age groups and what role does political interest in this?" --> Outcome variable ist political trust

###Models

options(scipen = 999) #to get whole numbers in the output


### Political Interest as outcome variable

#1. Age group only
mod1 <- lm(polintr_rev ~ age_group, data = dt_new)
summary(mod1)

#Intercept = 2.145 → This is the mean value of the outcome (e.g. polintr_rev, political interest reversed) for people under 30 (<30).
#age_group30–59 = 0.219 → People aged 30–59 score on average 0.219 points higher than those under 30, all else equal.
#age_group60+ = 0.369 → People aged 60+ score on average 0.369 points higher than those under 30
#--> political interest higher for older people



#2. Adding trstplt as control variable
mod2 <- lm(polintr_rev ~ age_group + trstplt, data = dt_new)
summary(mod2)

#Age and trust both positively predict political interest (reversed scale)
#Older people and more trusting people are more interested in politics (as measured by reversed scale)



#3. Interaction with trust to see if trust matters more/less by age
mod3 <- lm(polintr_rev ~ age_group + trstplt + age_group * trstplt , data = dt_new)
summary(mod3)

#model tells us how the slope for trust differs by age group
#30–59-year-olds: Slope = 0.066 + 0.028 = 0.094 -> They are more responsive to political trust than under-30s
#60+ year-olds: Slope = 0.066 + 0.029 = 0.095 -> Also more responsive than under-30s
#Political trust predicts political interest more strongly in older age groups than in younger people



#4. adding media use as predictors
mod4 <- lm(polintr_rev ~ age_group + trstplt + nwspol + netustm + netusoft, data = dt_new)
summary(mod4)
# small coefficients but also small unit scale of variables (measured in minutes)
#Intercept:	1.1557 is predicted political interest (reversed) for reference group (age <30, with 0 trust/media use)
#age_group30–59: +0.297 -> This age group scores 0.297 higher than under 30s, holding all else constant
#age_group60+: +0.664 -> This group scores 0.664 higher than under 30s
#trstplt: +0.0838 -> For each one-unit increase in political trust, political interest goes up by 0.084
#nwspol (news about politics freq): +0.00069 -> For each unit increase, very small increase in interest (measured in minutes)
#netustm (internet use)	+0.00044	Also small but significant effect (measured in minutes)
#netusoft (internet use)	+0.106	One of the larger media effects (measured on scale)



#5. Full interaction model: adding age*media interaction to see if the effect of news consumption differs by age group
mod5 <- lm(polintr_rev ~ age_group * (trstplt + nwspol + netustm + netusoft), data = dt_new)
summary(mod5)

#Political trust is a strong predictor of political interest for all age groups, but it's especially strong for middle-aged adults (30–59)
#Political news consumption predicts greater interest in all age groups, with the effect slightly stronger among 60+
#General time online has a positive effect for under-30s and middle-aged groups, but the effect weakens for older adults, nearly disappearing
#Frequency of internet use predicts higher political interest in under-30s only; no significant age-based moderation



#6. Also possible: Stepwise interaction for each media variable individually
mod5b <- lm(polintr_rev ~ age_group + trstplt + nwspol + age_group * nwspol, data = dt_new)
summary(mod5b)



#7. interaction between media*trust to explore whether the impact of trust on political interest depends on media usage patterns.
mod6 <- lm(polintr_rev ~ age_group + trstplt * (nwspol + netustm + netusoft), data = dt_new)
summary(mod6)



#8. Fully Saturated Model (all Interactions) but only if we have enough data and want to explore complex interactions
mod7 <- lm(polintr_rev ~ age_group * (nwspol + netustm + netusoft) +
                            trstplt * (nwspol + netustm + netusoft), data = dt_raw)
summary(mod7)



#Comparing all models
install.packages("modelsummary", type = "binary")
library(modelsummary)

modelsummary(
  list(
    "Model 1" = mod1,
    "Model 2" = mod2,
    "Model 3" = mod3,
    "Model 4" = mod4,
    "Model 5" = mod5,

    "Model 7" = mod7
  ),
  statistic = "std.error",  # or "conf.int" if you prefer confidence intervals
  stars = TRUE,
  title = "Table: Predicting Political Interest"
)



### Political Trust as outcome variable (to see if results are more interesting)

#1. Age group and political interest as control variables
mod8 <- lm(trstplt ~ age_group + polintr_rev, data = dt_new)
summary(mod8)



#2.Interaction with political interest to see if it matters more/less by age
mod9 <- lm(trstplt ~ age_group + polintr_rev + age_group * polintr_rev , data = dt_new)
summary(mod9)



#3. adding media use as predictors
mod10 <- lm(trstplt ~ age_group + polintr_rev + nwspol + netustm + netusoft, data = dt_new)
summary(mod10)



#4. Full interaction model: adding age*media interaction to see if the effect of news consumption differs by age group
mod11 <- lm(trstplt ~ age_group * (polintr_rev + nwspol + netustm + netusoft), data = dt_new)
summary(mod11)

#Political interest increases political trust most for older age groups
#Time spent online (netustm) is negatively related to political trust — but this relationship changes with age:
# -It’s less negative for 30–59-year-olds, and more negative for people aged 60+
# -Political news use and soft media use don’t show clear or consistent age-based differences



#5. interaction between media*political interest to explore whether the impact of interest on trust depends on media usage patterns.
mod12 <- lm(trstplt ~ age_group + polintr_rev * (nwspol + netustm + netusoft), data = dt_new)
summary(mod12)

#Political interest is a strong predictor of political trust
#Older people are slightly less trusting, controlling for other variables
#Media use interacts with interest:
# - Political interest leads to more trust, but less so among people who are more exposed to political news and who are online more
# - In other words, the more media people consume, the weaker the link between political engagement and trust becomes
